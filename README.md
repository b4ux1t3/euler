This is a list of files associated with solving problems on Project Euler. They were developed by Chris Pilcher for the express purpose of breaking in new languages.

This will be updated soon with instructions on how to run these programs. However, you will need several different languages installed.

Currently, the languages used are:

* [Python](http://python.org)
* [Go](http://golang.org)
